---

Regaliz is a simple package that contains implementations of popular algorithms and data structures in TypeScript. 

Each algorithm and data structure will have explanations from [Algus Dark](https://tweet.algus.ninja) in videos/posts related to his work on [Codeando Pues](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaRp1KzFEEpBbBpr8mMm0jg) (ðŸ˜“ _only in spanish at first release_).

_This project is meant to be used **only** for learning, research and usage in some solutions of [programming puzzles](https://github.com/AlgusDark/programming-puzzles). **It is not meant to be used for production**._
